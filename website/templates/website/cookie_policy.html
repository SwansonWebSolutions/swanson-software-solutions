    <h2>What Are Cookies?</h2>
    <p>Cookies are small text files placed on your device to store data that can be retrieved by the website that set them. Similar technologies include pixels, local storage, and server logs.</p>

      <li><strong>Functional:</strong> Remember choices (e.g., language) to provide enhanced features.</li>
      <li><strong>Marketing:</strong> Used to deliver or measure ads and track campaign performance (used sparingly, if at all).</li>
