    <h2>Understanding Our Service</h2>
    <h3>Q1: What does SwanTech’s Do Not Call / Stop My Spam service do?</h3>
    <p>We provide a technical assistance service that helps consumers register their phone number and email address with national and state‑level “Do Not Contact” registries. We handle the entire process — from submitting the request to confirming your registration — so you no longer receive unwanted marketing calls or emails.</p>

    <h3>Q2: Are you affiliated with the government or the FTC?</h3>
    <p>No. SwanTech is an independent technology service. We are not affiliated with any government agency. We act as your authorized agent, submitting official opt‑out requests on your behalf to government‑managed registries and private marketing databases.</p>

    <h3>Q3: How does the process work?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Verify your email and/or phone number.</li>
      <li>Submit official opt‑out and suppression requests through recognized registry systems.</li>
      <li>Confirm your registration status and provide documentation for your records.</li>
      <li>Continuously maintain your opt‑out status with marketing databases that frequently refresh lists.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Q4: What’s the difference between the “Do Not Call” and “Stop My Spam” services?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Do Not Call Registry:</strong> Prevents telemarketers from calling your registered number.</li>
      <li><strong>Stop My Spam:</strong> Submits requests under privacy laws (like CCPA/CPRA) to prevent companies from sending unsolicited marketing emails or selling your data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Protection & Compliance</h2>
    <h3>Q5: How do you protect my personal information?</h3>
    <p>Your data is encrypted and never sold or shared. We use secure, industry‑standard methods to transmit and store your contact details only for the purpose of fulfilling your registration requests.</p>

    <h3>Q6: Will you send my information to marketers?</h3>
    <p>No. We only send your data to official registries and approved opt‑out systems. We never send your information to marketers or advertisers.</p>

    <h3>Q7: Is this service CCPA compliant?</h3>
    <p>Yes. Our process aligns with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and CPRA. By authorizing SwanTech, you’re allowing us to act as your designated agent to execute your opt‑out rights.</p>

    <h2>Service Details</h2>
    <h3>Q8: How long does it take for calls and emails to stop?</h3>
    <p><strong>Calls:</strong> Most telemarketing calls stop within 30 days of registration.</p>
    <p><strong>Emails:</strong> Marketing emails typically stop within 7–14 days after your opt‑out request is processed. However, you may still receive messages from organizations you’ve done business with previously (as permitted by law).</p>

    <h3>Q9: How do I confirm I’ve been registered?</h3>
    <p>We’ll send you a confirmation email with your registration details and instructions on how to verify your status directly through the official registries.</p>

    <h3>Q10: Can I remove multiple phone numbers or emails at once?</h3>
    <p>Yes. You can register multiple phone numbers and email addresses in a single submission. Each one will be processed individually and verified for compliance.</p>

    <h2>Payment & Authorization</h2>
    <h3>Q11: Why is there a fee?</h3>
    <p>Our fee covers the technical and administrative work required to process, verify, and maintain your opt‑out registrations across multiple databases. Government registries themselves are free, but SwanTech saves you the time and ensures ongoing enforcement.</p>

    <h3>Q12: How long does my registration last?</h3>
    <p><strong>Do Not Call:</strong> Permanent (unless your number changes).</p>
    <p><strong>Stop My Spam:</strong> We maintain your registration for 12 months, and you can renew anytime.</p>

    <h3>Q13: Can I cancel or update my registration?</h3>
    <p>Yes. Simply contact us through our support form, and we can update, renew, or remove your opt‑out registration at any time.</p>

    <h2>Troubleshooting & Support</h2>
    <h3>Q14: I’m still getting calls or emails — what should I do?</h3>
    <p>Occasionally, it can take a few weeks for all marketing systems to update. If the problem continues, contact us and we’ll investigate and re‑submit your request where necessary.</p>

    <h3>Q15: How do I contact SwanTech Support?</h3>
    <p>You can reach us anytime at <a href="mailto:support@swantech.org">support@swantech.org</a> or through our <a href="{% url 'website:contact' %}">Contact Sales / Support</a> page.</p>

    <h2>🛡️ Transparency Statement</h2>
    <h3>Q16: Is this the official National Do Not Call Registry?</h3>
    <p>No. The official registry is operated by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). SwanTech acts as your technical representative to register your information on the official database and related suppression systems.</p>

    <h3>Q17: Do you guarantee I’ll never get spam calls or emails again?</h3>
    <p>While no service can guarantee complete elimination, SwanTech significantly reduces unwanted contacts by registering and maintaining your opt-outs across multiple verified databases.</p>
